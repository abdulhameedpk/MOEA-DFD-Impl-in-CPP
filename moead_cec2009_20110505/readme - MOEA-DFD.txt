1. run moead_cpp/moea_cpp to get the data files (in POF folder). The files are compiled and executed on Ubuntu 64 bit.

2. run Matlab script result/sta.m to get the statistical results which are saved in tabs.txt. (a more readable table is in tabs.xls). The Matlab scripts can be executed directly on Windows 7 64 bit. 

3. To run Matlab script on Linux, recompile the cpp files through mex.

3. MOEA/DFD and MOEAD algorithms are implemented in moead_cpp/algorithm.h
