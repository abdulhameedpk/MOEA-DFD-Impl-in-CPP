# MOEA-DFD-Impl-in-CPP
C++ implementation of MOEA/DFD algorithm


NOTE: This source code is neither examined nor verified by the authors of MOEA/DFD. A thorough understanding of the algorithm as well as 
       validation of this code is thus recommended.  




1. run /moead_cec2009_20110505/moead_cpp/moea_cpp to get the data files (in POF folder). I have compiled the cpp code in Eclipse c++ IDE for Ubuntu 64-bit.

2. run Matlab script /moead_cec2009_20110505/result/sta.m to get the statistical results which are saved in tabs.txt. (a more readable table is in tabs.xls). 

 The Matlab scripts are precompiled fpr Windows 7 64 bit. 

3. To run Matlab script on Linux, recompile the cpp files through mex.

3. MOEA/DFD and MOEAD algorithms are implemented in moead_cpp/algorithm.h
